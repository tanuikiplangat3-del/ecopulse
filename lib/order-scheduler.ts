// for funded orders whose turnaround has run out, cancels them and refunds the
// buyer. Missing a pass is harmless - the next one picks the order up, and the
// refund is the same whenever it happens.
//
// The actual cancel + refund lives in lib/orders.ts and is guarded so two
// passes (or a pass and an admin clicking Cancel at the same moment) can never
// refund one order twice.
